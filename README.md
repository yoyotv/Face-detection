# Face-detection-and-recognition
Face detection and recognition without using opencv.

This repository refer to the paper "Eigenfaces for recognition"[[1]](http://www.face-rec.org/algorithms/pca/jcn.pdf)  which is the first implementation of eigenvectors in recognizing faces.

Also, this repository is just for imporving my ability of implement the concept of only reading paper.So the code follows the steps that paper wrote.

## Approach 

Pricipal component analysis (PCA)
Eigenvector and eigenvalue
Detail is all in the paper.


## GET started

Success in :

C++ 11, opencv(just for reading and diplaying)

I do use opencv, but just for reading and diplay the image.

## Try 

First, extract the ATT.rar to the folder "Face_recognition".

And just run the main.cpp !

## Results

If everthing is fine.

You can see somthing like this ![result]()
